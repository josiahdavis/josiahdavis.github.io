## Data Science at General Assembly

I was the co-instructor for two iterations of [General Assembly's 66-hour Data Science course](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science). The course covered the complete data science pipeline with a focus on predictive analytics in Python (scikit-learn, statsmodels, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, nltk). During this time I received the highest student rating in this history of the course across all campuses.
