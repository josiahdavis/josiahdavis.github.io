Hi there, my name is Josiah. 

For the past decade+ I've been working on the development and application of AI/ML to real-world problems.

Currently, I'm a Senior Applied Scientist at Amazon Last Mile.

Previsouly, I worked at Amazon's Supply Chain Optimization Technology (SCOT) organization. Before that, I was a founding member of the Amazon Machine Learning Solutions Lab with AWS.

I have a mixed STEM background, earning my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from University of Maryland, and my Master's degree in Statistics from University of Californnia, Berkeley.

This blog is an experiment, I plan to publish 6 times initially to see if the benefit and usefulness is high enough to justify the time I put in it.
