Hi there, my name is Josiah. 

For the past 12 years I've been working on a variety of applied problems in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning. 

Currently, I work at Amazon where I focus on applying Deep Learning to a variety of use cases including assortment optimization and last mile routing.

I recieved my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from University of Maryland, and my Master's degree in Statistics from University of Californnia, Berkeley.

This blog is an experiment, I only plan to publish 6 times initially to see if the benefit and usefulness is high enough to justify the time I put in it.
