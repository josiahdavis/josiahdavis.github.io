synopsis: The most anticipated place to get coffee is Krispy Kreme. It makes sense, people likely eat donuts much less than they drink coffee, so when they go, it’s a special event.

Not bad, apparently.

The chart below plots the average emotional valence contained within Yelp reviews for coffee shops across 8 emotions: four positive emotions on the left, and four negative emotions on the right.

Apparently, most anticipated place to get coffee is Krispy Kreme. It makes sense, people likely eat donuts much less than they drink coffee, so when they go, it’s a special event.

The greatest joy seems to be coming from the Other category, possibly a testament to the romance often associated with independent boutique coffee shops.

Interestingly, Starbucks seems to provide a less emotionally rich experience than going to other coffee shops. Possibly, this is due to the fact that Starbucks customers disproportionately dilute their coffee with cream and sugar, and thus dilute their coffee-drinking experience.
