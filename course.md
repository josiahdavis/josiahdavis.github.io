Starting **July 1st, 2016**, I am offering an online course, **Data Science with Trees in Python**. This comprehensive overview will give you all the tools you need to break into the field of data science. In this course you will learn:  

#### Introduction

* ​							What Machine Learning is.
* ​	How to pivot from Analyst to Data Scientist.
* How to sell your client or manager on Machine Learning.
* Why tree-based methods are the best way to break into Data Science.

####Decision Trees

* The pros and cons of tree-based methods in comparison to other modeling techniques.
* How to visualize machine learning models.
* Classification and Regression Trees
* How to explain your modeling results to a non-technical audience.
* How to implement Classification and Regression Trees in Python using the scikit learn package.

####Ensembling

- What ensembling is and why it improves modeling accuracy.
- Four different ways to ensemble machine learning models.
- How to get the most out of your ensemble approach.
- Two popular tree-based methods: Random Forests and AdaBoost.
- How to implement Random Forests and AdaBoost in Python using the scikit learn package.

####Model Validation

- How to measure the accuracy of a predictive model
- Root Mean Squared Error and Cross Validation
- Hyper Parameter tuning for Random Forests, AdaBoost, and Classification and Regression Trees (CART).



## Course Philosophy

- Seeing examples are of ultimate importance.
- Intuition and conceptual explanations over mathematical formalism.
- Learning how to learn is better than reliance on the instructor.
- Nuance is essential to understand tradeoffs between different modeling approaches.
- No black boxes. If it can't be explained its usefulness will be limited.



##About The Instructor

My name is Josiah. I have over 12,000 hours providing data science services to companies across many diverse industries. Some of my clients include:

* Walmart
* Department of Veteran Affairs
* Pacific Gas & Electric
* First Republic Bank
* Genentech
* CVS Caremark
* Internal Revenue Service
* Johnson & Johnson

In addition to my professional experience, I was an instructor for General Assembly's Data Science course, a 66-hour accelerated learning program for adults. Many of my students had advanced degrees in scientific disciplines. During my time with [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science) I was rated as one of the top two Data Science instructors across all campuses. Additionally, I have provided 1-on-1 mentoring to over 25 individuals through [SpringBoard's](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science-intensive/) Data Science workshop.

##Testimonials

## Logistics and Prerequisites

- The course will launch on **July 1st, 2016**, and will **cost $499**. If for any reason you are unsatisfied with the course within the first 30 days you will receive a full refund with no questions asked.
- All learners will leave the course with several Python notebooks complete with explanations, numerous examples covering each concept, and links to additional resources
- All learners must have a downloaded copy of the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for Python 3.5 and the ability to execute code in an IPython notebook
- Prior scripting experience in Python is a prerequisite. You should know basic python concepts (e.g., basic data types and data structures) and how to manipulate data before you take this course.
- Prior experience in probability and statistics is a plus but is not necessary. There are no hard mathematical prerequisites for taking this course
