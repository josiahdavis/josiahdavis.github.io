# Learning Pandas The Right Way



> Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime. - Maimonides



### Context

What is pandas? Pandas, which stands for **Pan**el **D**ata **A**nalysi**s**, is an open source python package used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. People love using pandas because it is fast, flexible, and intuitive. One of the best things about pandas is it's excellent documentation. For an more comprehensive overview of the capabilities of pandas, let's go to the [home page](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/.) of the documentation. 

> [Pandas has the] goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language.



> Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:
> 
> * Powerful, flexible **group by** functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data
> * Flexible **reshaping** and pivoting of data sets
> * **Time series**-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging, etc.

That was merely a brief excerpt to whet your appetite, I highly recommend reading this page beginning to end.

### Getting to Hello World

The best way to learn is to get started analyzing real data on your computer. If you're new to python, I recommend downloading the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) of python, which includes python and the pandas package. You can check that you have the package by typing in the following into your command line / terminal (in case you're wondering, pip is a package management tool for python):

``` 
pip show pandas
```

If you get a message telling you the version of pandas, something like this, you've installed everything correctly:

```
