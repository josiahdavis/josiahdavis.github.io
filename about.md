### Hi, I'm Josiah.
I work as a Data Scientist in San Francisco. My background is primarily in Applied Machine Learning ([Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/)) and Data Visualization ([D3.js](http://d3js.org/)) but I'm always learning new things. For the past 6+ years, I have created quantitative analysis for organizations across many industries including Federal Government, Consumer Products and Health Care. Previously, I graduated from the University of Maryland with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering.

### I would love to meet you.
In addition to this site, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/josiahjdavis) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/josiahdavis). Outside of Data Science, I love spending my free time listening to Hardcore History, volunteering at church, and exploring the claims-to-fame of the U.S. with my wife and small daughter.

### I'm not a journalist, but I love finding an interesting story.
I created this site because I wanted an outlet to explore interesting ideas and share them with others. I hope you enjoy it!
