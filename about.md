### Hi there, I'm Josiah.
I'm currently working as a Data Scientist and I have 6+ years of experience creating quantitative analysis across the Federal Government, Finance, Consumer Products, Health, and Defense Industries. My expertise is in Applied Machine Learning ([Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/)) and Data Visualization ([D3.js](http://d3js.org/)) but I'm always learning new things. Previously, I graduated from the University of Maryland where I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering.

### I would love to meet you.
Please reach out. Outside of this site, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/josiahjdavis) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/josiahdavis). I live in San Francisco and I enjoy talking about podcasts, TV, and all things data science.

### This site is dedicated to exploration
I'm not a journalist, but I love finding an interesting story. I created this site because I wanted an outlet to explore interesting ideas and share them with others. I hope you enjoy your time here!
