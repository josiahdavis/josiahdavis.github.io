<p>
I'm a data scientist and consultant working in San Francisco. Previously, I was an instructor of General Assembly's 66-hour Data Science course where I was rated by students as one of the top two instructors in the history of the course. I am currently enrolled in graduate studies in Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
