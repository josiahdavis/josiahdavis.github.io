title: How hard is it to get into an Ivy League University?
---

## Conventional Wisdom
The eight schools that make up the Ivy league, have a reputation for academic rigor and exclusivity. But how hard is it really to gain admittance? Most people will tell you that it is extremely competitive to get in, and this makes sense. If you are affiliated with the school in some way, it perpetuates your brand. If you are an admissions consultant, it increases your chances of gaining clients.

## The Probability of Getting into at least one
Let's say that a student meet's these requirements and applies to all 8 Ivy League universities, what is this student's chance? A careful thinker will be aware that the chances of acceptance are greater than the number that is quoted on any given University's website (usually < %10). If you model the acceptance to college with a [binomial distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution), the chances of getting into an Ivy Leabue University are closer to %80-90.

## Objection: Merit counts
There are typically two types of students that apply to Ivy League universities. Let's call them Group 1 and Group 2. Group 1 is comprised of outliers: people that have extraordinary circumstances that make their acceptance probable (e.g., being the child of a former U.S. president) or people who fall below the universities normally acceptable SAT / GPA ranges and are simply applying as a sort of "hail mary". Group 2 are the students who have GPA / SAT scores within the range of what the school typically accepts, and possibly represent the majority of applicants What is the acceptable range? The incoming classs of University of Pennsylvania, one of the largest Ivy League universities, had a middle 50% SAT range between 2050 and 2330 and their average GPA was 3.9.
