Mississippi, from their 1861 State Convention meeting notes (emphasis in the original):

> **A DECLARATION**  

> **Of the immediate causes which induce and justify the secession of the State of Mississippi from the Federal Union.**

> In the momentous step which our State has taken of dissolving its connection with the government of which we so long formed a part, it is but just that we should declare the prominent reasons which have induced our course.

> Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery--the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of the commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery, is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has long been aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.

> That we do not overstate the dangers to our institution, a reference to a few facts will sufficiently prove.

> The hostility to this institution commenced before the adoption of the Constitution, and was manifested in the well-known Ordinance of 1787, in regard to the North-western territory.

> The feeling increased, until, in 1819-20, it deprived the South of more than half the vast territory acquired from France.

> The same hostility dismembered Texas, and seized upon all the territory acquired from Mexico.

> It has grown until it denies the right of property in slaves, and refuses protection to that right on the high seas, in the territories, and whenever the government of the United States had jurisdiction.

> It refuses the admission of new slave States into the Union, and seeks to extinguish it by confining it within its present limits, denying the power of expansion.

> It tramples the original equality of the South under foot.

> It has nullified the Fugitive Slave Law in almost every free State in the Union, and has utterly broken the compact which our fathers pledged their faith to maintain.

> It advocates negro equality, socially and politically, and promotes insurrection and incendiarism in our midst.

> It has enlisted the press, its pulpit and its schools against us, until the whole popular mind of the North is excited and inflamed with prejudice.
