## Lights over Phoenix

  > While doing astrophotography I observed five yellow-white lights in a "V" formation moving slowly from the northwest, across the sky to the northeast, then turn almost due south and continue until out of sight. The point of the "V" was in the direction of movement. The first three lights were in a fairly tight "V" while two of the lights were further back along the lines of the "V"'s legs. During the NW-NE transit one of the trailing lights moved up and joined the three and then dropped back to the trailing position. I estimated the three ;ight "V" to cover about 0.5 degrees of sky and the whole group of five lights to cover about 1 degree of sky. (Prescott, AZ, March 19, 1997)
