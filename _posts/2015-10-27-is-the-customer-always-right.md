title: Is the Customer always right?
synopsis: Slogans are by definition everywhere. But all slogans deserve qualification.

## Origin story

"The Customer Is Always Right."

Within America, the credit for this slogan usually goes to Marshall Field, a business retail magnate during the period of America's gilded age. The company he helped build, Marshall Field's (originally P. Palmer & Co.), is credited with pioneering several retail practices that are now considered common. These innovations include: giving customers access to a free personal shopper, the one-price price-tag, being able to return a product for any reason, and the bridal registry. Given the typical retail experience at the time, Marshall Field's company marked radical departure from current retail practices which was often better defined the phrase: "let the buyer beware".

After changing owners multiple times in the 1980s and 1990s (there was a period of 14 years where Marshall Field's was owned by Target), in 2005 the stores were acquired by Federated Department Stores, currently known as Macy's. When roughly a year and a half later, it was announced that Marshall Field's stores would be re-branded as Macy's, many Marshall Field's customers were outraged. Customers felt an emotional connection with the store, and many protested the decision to change the name. However, management at Macy's didn't change their mind.

## All slogans deserve qualification
Slogans, or common sayings, are by definition everywhere. They are used in business marketing, political campaigns, and in our every day life. And slogans can be useful in highlighting something of importance. Take the common phrase: "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush", which means that it's better to have a garaunteed small reward than to take a risk for a large reward. And this is *generally* true. But there are also situations where the principle doesn't apply. If this was never the case, many of the large companies which exist today (such as Macy's, for instance), would not exist since opening a new store inevitably involves risk.

Compared with the gilded age, there are many more forums now for customers to make their voice heard. If a customer likes or dislikes their experience with a business, there are no shortage of mediums for them to vocalize their opinions. And this is generally a good thing. However, it can present a challenge for business, as they seek to collect, interpret and respond to their customers' feedback. The goal of this article is to demonstrate three ways in which businesses can identify the most relevant customer feedback by qualifying the popular slogan:

* Some customer complaints are more common than others
* Some customer feedback is more useful than others
* Some customers are more nuanced than others

In honor of the American store most responsible for popularizing the slogan, these examples will be drawn from customer reviews of Macy's.

## Some customer complaints are more common than others

Department stores and complaining customers and  go hand-in-hand. It's like having a crying baby on an airplane and disgruntled passengers. One is generally not found without the other. But some customer complaints are more prevelant than others. Let's take a look at some of the common themes most commonly associated with negative reviews[2].

Perhaps unsurprisingly, this data suggests that people shop at Macy's for the combination of quality goods at affordable prices, and at a convenient location. Interestingly, many of the words commonly associated with customer service such as Associate, Management, Help, Register, Delivery, and Returns, are more frequently found in negative reviews. This means that customers were more likely to mentioned a specific interaction with an employee if they had a negative shopping experience. Going department by department, there is a lot of variation, with the shoes department scoring the highest, several departments scoring as neutral - Bedding, Purses, and Furniture, for instance - and Jewelry scoring the lowest.

## Some customer feedback is more useful than others

<iframe src="http://bl.ocks.org/josiahdavis/raw/ba23b5ebf0ed1b8d3eb2/" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" height="500px" width="960px" scrolling="no"></iframe>

In many cases, customers who leave feedback have good intentions. They want the business to know what they really need, and they want to inform their fellow customers. However, not all customer feedback is equally useful. Some customers simply don't have much to say. One customer's entire review consisted of the following:
> Really an enjoyable Macy's. not too big but has all your needs. Customer service is also good!

Other customers use social media as platforms for venting. For instance, one despondent customer said:
> Macy's is not Marshall Fields, nor will it ever be. Maybe it is more like Marshall's, without the low prices...

But what makes a review useful? It depends on many factors, but one thing is clear. All human beings are vulnerable to letting one aspect of an experience bias their opinion of all aspects of their experience. This is commonly referred to as the [Halo Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect). Perhaps this is one reason why there are more useful 2, 3, and 4 star reviews, than 1 and 5 star reviews.

## Some customers are more nuanced than others

<iframe src="http://bl.ocks.org/josiahdavis/raw/c9de555e22ad56bf5f8b/" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" height="250px" width="960px" scrolling=""></iframe>

The Halo Effect can be assessed by looking at the association between the sentiment contained in the text and the overall rating of the review itself. A positive review that has entirely positive sentiment, or a negative review with entirely negative sentiment, may be a sign of what psychologists call exaggerated emotional coherence. For instance the following review, while quite lengthy doesn't have a single positive statement in it:
> "Macy's Womens Shoes, What can I say...... I go there with my Mom shopping.  We were bombarded by sales people one after the other saying ""can I help you find something"".  (Even after we had been helped) How annoying. We Find the shoe we like and the sales rep goes to look for it in the back.  The wait for the show was almost 30 min.  By the time the rep returned we just wanted to leave. (And almost did)  The shoe didn't fit and after the wait we had, we decided to get on with our lives and NOT waster another 1/2 hour or more waiting to find the next pair. Can you say E-F-F-I-C-I-E-N-C-Y. PLEASE do better next time."

Conversely, positive sentiments within negative reviews and the negative sentiments within positive reviews should be given extra credence, since they are less likely to be the result of this cognitive bias. For instance, this reviewer considered her experience to be generally negative, but that didn't stop her from saying several positive things as well:
> ...I went prom dress shopping with my sister and we found 2 dresses that she loved. We decided to buy both of them so that we could take them both home to get my parents' opinions. I went to return one of the dresses, with the original receipt, and they told me that I could only get partial store credit and partial cash. Apparently because my sister had used her Visa giftcard to pay for the dress, they wouldn't give me cash for that portion of the return and would only give me store credit. The only reason they are even getting 2 stars is because I was able to find a few decently priced things after I shopped just about every rack in the store...

## The need for faster horses
Henry Ford famously said "if I asked the customer what they wanted, they would have asked for faster horses." And this attitude served him well for a time. In 1922, [half of America's cars](https://www.thehenryford.org/exhibits/hf/The_Innovator_and_Ford_Motor_Company.asp) were made by the Ford Motor Company. But that's not the whole story. Ford was notoriously stubborn, and was slow to realize to that his Model T needed to be improved. For nearly 20 years, the Model T was the only car produced by the Ford Motor company. This gave time for competitors to catch up, and by 1936 the Ford Motor company trailed both General Motors and Chrysler Co. in sales.

When it comes to listening to feedback it's easy to take an all-or-nothing approach. Business leaders would do well to avoid both extremes. In other words: the customer is always right is right, but some customers are more right than others.

### Notes:

**[1]** Identifying common themes was accomplished here by using a custom dictionary of word patters. The word patterns were defined after looking at the most frequent tokens after removing stopwords and identifying parts of speech.
**[2]** Colors are based off of the [augmented term frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf#Term_frequency_2) contained in negative (1-3 star) and positive (4-5 star) reviews.
