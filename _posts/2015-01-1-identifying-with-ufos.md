title: Identifying with UFOs
---


*[Daniel Henebery](www.questionable-economics.com) and I wrote this article and conducted this analysis together. We would like to thank the National UFO Reporting Center for making the data available. Without you, this would not be possible.*

First, aliens exist.

The anecdotal evidence supporting the existence of extra-terrestrial beings is extensive and undeniable.

  > While doing astrophotography I observed five yellow-white lights in a "V" formation moving slowly from the northwest, across the sky to the northeast, then turn almost due south and continue until out of sight.... During the NW-NE transit one of the trailing lights moved up and joined the three and then dropped back to the trailing position. I estimated the three ;ight "V" to cover about 0.5 degrees of sky and the whole group of five lights to cover about 1 degree of sky. (Prescott, AZ, March 19, 1997)

This detailed description is but one of over 80,000 UFO sighting that have been recorded by the [The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC)](http://www.nuforc.org/). According to its website, NUFORC's mission is: to "receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events." To this end, the center relies on individuals to report UFO sightings. Many do directly and many more are referred to the NUFORC by the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Weather Services, NASA, and 911 emergency dispatchers.

The NUFORC maintains these reports in an [online database](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxevent.html) available for the public to download. An Analysis of reported sighting densities across time yields interesting facts about aliens beyond their mere existence.


## Aliens Watch the X-Files
In September 1993, the cult television show [The X-Files]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files) premiered. 12 million people--about 5% of the US population at the time—watched the premier and 27 million watched during the show’s peak in 1997.  It is likely that these numbers are low, as they only count human viewership.

The main storyline of the show follows the interactions between extra-terrestrials and FBI Special Agents Mulder and Scully. As a result, aliens are a natural extension of the show’s target demographic. While Nielson ratings for [Kepler 438b]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-438b) are not yet available, the record clearly shows a statistically significant structural-break in the number of reported sightings in 1993. Much like [Downton Abbey fans]( http://www.salon.com/2012/01/27/is_it_ok_to_steal_downton_abbey/) more and more aliens wanted to see each new season before it was made available locally.


## Aliens Are Patriotic
I have found that one of the biggest misconceptions about Aliens lies is the belief, perhaps perpetuated by their representation in Hollywood, that Aliens are bent on world domination. Indeed from my research, it appears that Aliens are actually quite patriotic. As you can see from the chart below, Aliens are more likely to visit the earth on the 4th of July than any other day, a sure tribute to our founding fathers. Perhaps the skeptic in you questions whether Aliens are just after the food. If that was the case, why don't you see corresponding activity for other major holidays such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter?

## Aliens enjoy a good time
Another widely-held misconception is that Aliens are aloof and distant creatures. While there are surely differences between them and us, Aliens are actually, more fun-loving that we might think. As the chart below indicates, you are more likely to see an Alien on a Friday or Saturday night than any other time of the week. 

## Down to earth
To the skeptic I challenge you to re-consider your views in light of the data. Is it possible that Aliens are not cold-hearted villians, bent on world domination? Is it possible that Aliens are actually supportive of our National traditions and inhabitance on earth? Is it possible that Aliens are not that much different than you and I?
