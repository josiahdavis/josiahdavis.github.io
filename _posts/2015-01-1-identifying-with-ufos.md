title: Identifying with UFOs
---

By now, most people have accepted the fact that we are not alone in this universe. Aliens exist, and we should treat with dignity and respect. However, surprisingly, there are still some who adamantly refuse to believe in Extraterrestrial life. In order to create awareness on this important topic, I wrote this with my colleague [Daniel Henebery](http://www.questionable-economics.com) to present analaysis that will help us to undertand our extraterrestrial brothers.

## Over 80,000 UFO Sighings
  > While doing astrophotography I observed five yellow-white lights in a "V" formation moving slowly from the northwest, across the sky to the northeast, then turn almost due south and continue until out of sight.... During the NW-NE transit one of the trailing lights moved up and joined the three and then dropped back to the trailing position. I estimated the three light "V" to cover about 0.5 degrees of sky and the whole group of five lights to cover about 1 degree of sky. (Prescott, AZ, March 19, 1997)

This detailed description is but one of over 80,000 UFO sighting that have been recorded by the [The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC)](http://www.nuforc.org/). The mission of the NUFORC, which was founded in 1974, is to "receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events." The NUFORC has a hotline that individuals call into to report a UFO sighting and, the FAA, the National Weather Services, NASA, and many 911 emergency dispatches regularly direct calls they recieve about UFO sightings to the NUFORC. If you would like to report a UFO sighting of your own, you can call 206-722-3000.

## Aliens Like X-Files
One of the most significant events in the recent past for Alien awareness was the release of the TV show [X-Files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files) in September of 1993 (see chart below). The X-Files premiere was watched by 12 million people (about 5% of the US population at the time), and it's viewership only went up from there which led to it becoming one of the longest running science fiction TV series of all time. The impact this show had was to gradually dispel skepticism about the existence of Aliens. While possibly unrealistic in its representation on the nature of Aliens, the X-files TV show helped to shift the converstaion from "Do aliens exist?" to "What are aliens like?".

## Aliens Are Patriotic
I have found that one of the biggest misconceptions about Aliens lies is the belief, perhaps perpetuated by their representation in Hollywood, that Aliens are bent on world domination. Indeed from my research, it appears that Aliens are actually quite patriotic. As you can see from the chart below, Aliens are more likely to visit the earth on the 4th of July than any other day, a sure tribute to our founding fathers. Perhaps the skeptic in you questions whether Aliens are just after the food. If that was the case, why don't you see corresponding activity for other major holidays such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter?

## Aliens enjoy a good time
Another widely-held misconception is that Aliens are aloof and distant creatures. While there are surely differences between them and us, Aliens are actually, more fun-loving that we might think. As the chart below indicates, you are more likely to see an Alien on a Friday or Saturday night than any other time of the week.

## Down to earth
To the skeptic I challenge you to re-consider your views in light of the data. Is it possible that Aliens are not cold-hearted villians, bent on world domination? Is it possible that Aliens are actually supportive of our National traditions and inhabitance on earth? Is it possible that Aliens are not that much different than you and I?
