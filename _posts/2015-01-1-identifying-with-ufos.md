title: Identifying with UFOs
---


*[Daniel Henebery](www.questionable-economics.com) and I wrote this article and conducted this analysis together. We would like to thank the National UFO Reporting Center for making the data available. Without you, this would not be possible.*

First, aliens exist.

This is evident from extensive anecdotal evidence supporting the existence of extra-terrestrial beings. Consider this account from Prescott, Arizona on March 19, 1997:

The anecdotal evidence supporting the existence of extra-terrestrial beings is extensive and undeniable.

>While doing astrophotography I observed five yellow-white lights in a "V" formation moving slowly from the northwest, across the sky to the northeast, then turn almost due south and continue until out of sight…During the transit, one of the trailing lights moved up and joined the three and then dropped back to the trailing position. I estimated the three light "V" to cover about 0.5 degrees of sky and the whole group of five lights to cover about 1 degree of sky. 
This detailed account is one of over 80,000 documented by the [National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC)]( http://www.nuforc.org/). According to its website, NUFORC’s mission is: to "receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events." To this end, the center relies on individuals to submit reports of UFO sightings. Many do so directly and many more are referred by the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Weather Services, NASA, and 911 emergency dispatchers, all of whom regularly direct calls they receive about UFO sightings to the NUFORC.
The NUFORC maintains these reports in an [online database]( http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxevent.html) available for the public to download. Examining this data can yield many interesting insights about aliens beyond their mere existence. An analysis of reported sighting density across various partitions of time reveals certain alien preferences are curiously human. 

## Aliens Watch the X-Files

In September 1993, the cult television show [The X-Files]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files) premiered. 12 million people--about 5% of the US population at the time—watched the premier and 27 million watched during the show’s peak in 1997.  It is likely that these numbers are low, as they only count human viewership.

The main storyline of the show follows the interactions between extra-terrestrials and FBI Special Agents Mulder and Scully. As a result, aliens are a natural extension of the show’s target demographic. While Nielson ratings for [Kepler 438b]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-438b) are not yet available, the record clearly shows a statistically significant structural-break in the number of reported sightings in 1993. Much like [Downton Abbey fans]( http://www.salon.com/2012/01/27/is_it_ok_to_steal_downton_abbey/), more and more aliens wanted to see each new season before it was made available locally.

## Aliens Enjoy Keggers

The 24-hour day and the 7-day week only make sense on Earth, so one would not necessarily expect UFO activity to follow a daily or a weekly pattern. Yet, this is exactly what one finds in the data: On any day of the week, aliens are generally out between 6 PM and midnight, and they favor Friday and Saturday nights over Mondays and Tuesdays. 
This schedule only makes sense if alien activity follows some human activity. Given the bias towards the evening and the weekend, one can infer that the activity that aliens are interested in occurs during human leisure time. In other words, peak-UFO activity seems to occur at the same time as peak-college-fraternity-drinking activity.  This is speculative, but it could explain why UFOs that cross light years [crash as soon as they get to New Mexico]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell_UFO_incident).


## Aliens Love America

The movie [Independence Day]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629/) is slander and its director, [Roland Emmerich](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000386/?ref_=tt_ov_dr), is a hack. Aliens do not intend to conquer us. They love America and they love the 4th of July.
Mr. Emmerich’s idea of aliens is a paranoid delusion. Everyone knows extra-terrestrials come to earth every 4th of July to see the fireworks and eat hot dogs. The chart above shows this: In any given year, aliens are more likely to visit the earth on the 4th of July than any other day. And what else besides fireworks, hotdogs, and one terrible movie is that day known for? This plus the fact that the White House is still standing, suggests aliens are just here for the party.

##What Other Truths are Out There?
Aliens have other interests on Earth, which continued observation may help us to uncover. For example, the data also hints that aliens may come to earth to see the aurora borealis and the Leonid meteor shower or even to race experimental military aircraft. More years of observation are necessary and we sincerely hope NUFORC continues to archive these sightings. The insight it gives into human behavior is interesting--even for skeptics.
