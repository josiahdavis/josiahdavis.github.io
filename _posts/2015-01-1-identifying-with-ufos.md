title: Identifying with UFOs

*[Daniel Henebery](www.questionable-economics.com) and I create this analysis and article together. We would like to thank the National UFO Reporting Center for making the data available. Without you, this would not be possible.*

First, aliens exist.

This is evident from extensive anecdotal evidence supporting the existence of extra-terrestrial beings. Consider this account from Prescott, Arizona on March 19, 1997:

This detailed account is one of over 80,000 documented by the [National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC)]( http://www.nuforc.org/). According to its website, NUFORC’s mission is: to "receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events." To this end, the center relies on individuals to submit reports of UFO sightings. Many do so directly and many more are referred by the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Weather Services, NASA, and 911 emergency dispatchers, all of whom regularly direct calls they receive about UFO sightings to the NUFORC.
