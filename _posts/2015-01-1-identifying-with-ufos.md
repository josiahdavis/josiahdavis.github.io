title: Identifying with UFOs
---

By now, most modern people are aware of the fact that we as humans are not alone in this universe. However, surprisingly, there are still some who adamantly refuse to believe in Extraterrestrial life. In order to create awareness on this important topic, I wanted to present analaysis that will give us clues into the nature of alien life forms.

## Lights over Phoenix

  > While doing astrophotography I observed five yellow-white lights in a "V" formation moving slowly from the northwest, across the sky to the northeast, then turn almost due south and continue until out of sight. The point of the "V" was in the direction of movement. The first three lights were in a fairly tight "V" while two of the lights were further back along the lines of the "V"'s legs. During the NW-NE transit one of the trailing lights moved up and joined the three and then dropped back to the trailing position. I estimated the three ;ight "V" to cover about 0.5 degrees of sky and the whole group of five lights to cover about 1 degree of sky. (Prescott, AZ, March 19, 1997)

This description is but one of over 80,000 UFO sighting that have been recorded by the [The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC)](http://www.nuforc.org/). The mission of the NUFORC, which was founded in 1974, is to "receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events." The NUFORC has a hotline that individuals call into to report a UFO sighting and, the FAA, the National Weather Services, NASA, and many 911 emergency dispatches regularly direct calls they recieve about UFO sightings to the NUFORC. If you would like to report a UFO sighting of your own, you can call 206-722-3000.

## Clue #1: Aliens Like X-Files

Starting in 1993, there was a surge in reported UFO Sightings (see chart below.)

## The 1993 Surge in UFO Sightings
On September 10th, 1993, the first Season of X-Files premiered and was watched by over 12 million viewers, or 5% of the US population ([Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files)).  X-files grew in popularity, and ended airing 9 seasons. In light of the awareness about extraterestial life that this TV show created, it makes sense that more people would be accept the existence of Aliens.

In light of this data, the logical conclusion seems to me to me that this TV-show created an awareness of extreterrestial life.

## Clue #2: Aliens Are Patriotic

## The Best Time to See UFOs
Perhaps you are skeptical about the existence of Aliens, and are wondering if you can see one for yourself. There are two key trends in the data that can provide you with guidance here. First, due to their Aliens are much more likely to come out at night.

## Clue #3: Aliens enjoy a good time
