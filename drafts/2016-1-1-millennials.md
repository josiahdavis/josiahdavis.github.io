# What's wrong with Millennials?

*I would like to thank Jean Twenge and her colleagues for their work on analyzing generational differences. This analytical approach in this article is merely a reproduction and minor expansion of her work which you can read in full [here](http://jom.sagepub.com/content/early/2010/03/01/0149206309352246) . I would also like to thank the Institute of Social Research at the University of Michigan for administering the Monitoring the Future survey, without which this analysis would not be possible. The views and opinions in this article are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of Jean Twenge and her research associates.*

Millennials are seriously the worst. And I mean that in the best possible way. Being chronically inflicted by laziness, Millennials will do anything they can to get the job done, even if it means working over the weekends. Given that they are self-absorbed and narcissistic, its not surprising that all they want is to do is work for a company that cares about making a positive difference in society. As victims of over-protective parenting, by and large, they do not possess the ability work independently. This is why Millennials' biggest complaint is that they don't get enough feedback and direction from their managers. Naturally, this is because Millennials hate being managed and are generally distrustful of authority. Millennials are revolutionizing the world with the invention of new technologies that help people do their work more efficiently. Millennials have short attention spans which makes it difficult for them to stay focused at work.

When it comes to popular generalizations about Millennials, there is no shortage of contradictory conjecture and opinions.

The biggest source of confusion is measurement bias. At any single point in time, Millennials will also be younger than Generation X and the differences attributed to age and to generation cannot be separated. It's only when age is controlled for, that the differences due to generation can be isolated and that's what this story is about.

In 2008, Jean Twenge of the University of San Diego attempted to analyze generational differences that controlled for age-related differences. She analyzed survey responses to questions relating to workplace values using data they used came from the Monitoring the Future survey which is administered annually to randomly selected high school seniors. They analyzed data from 1976 (Baby Boomers), 1991 (Generation X), and 2006 (Millennials). For this article, I reproduced the original results and also tripled the size of the data by including 2 extra years for each generational cohort. Here are the years that were used for each generation in the expanded:

* Baby Boomers: High School Seniors in 1976, '77, '78
* Generation X: High School Seniors in 1990, '91, '92
* Millennials: High School Seniors in 2005, '06, '07

## How to read these charts

Survey respondents were asked questions with multiple choice answers on a likhart scale. For instance, How important is it to have a job that is interesting to do? 

1. Not Important
2. A Little Important
3. Pretty Important
4. Very Important

There are 19 questions like this, all designed to assess the value that each generation places on different aspects of work. Dr. Jean Twenge and her researchers split these questions up into six categories: Altruistic Rewards, Extrinsic Rewards, Intrinsic Rewards, Leisure Rewards, and Social Rewards.

The charts below show the standardized difference with the previous generation. Technically, the value is the [independent two-sample t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#Independent_two-sample_t-test) where the computations are performed by transforming the Likhart scale into numeric values (i.e., 4 for Very Important, 3 for Pretty Important, and so on.). In the results below,  Generation X is compared to Baby Boomers, and Millennials are compared with Generation X. 

The grey line is shows the data from the results I reproduced (three years) and the blue line is the data from the expanded dataset. The dark grey and light grey bands indicate the reference for statistical significance at the 95% and 99% confidence levels. Values outside of these grey bands indicate statistically reliable differences.

## Extrinsic Rewards

When it comes to extrinsic rewards, there is a clear generational difference, although it might be different than the one you were expecting. If Millennials are narcissistic, this data certainly doesn't reveal it. Millennials are less likely to value status and prestige in a job than Generation X, and they are also less interested in promotion and advancement in their career. However, these differences pale in comparison to the huge increase between the Baby Boomers and Generation X. In fact, of all of the survey questions these questions have the largest differences of any generational comparison. One theory on why this is true is that there is a cyclical nature to valuing extrinsic rewards like money, and prestige. If your parents were poor, chances are you wanted to make a better life. If your parents were well-to-do but had a poor work-life balance, maybe you went to the other extreme. While this makes sense on an individual level, what's interesting here is to see the pattern emerge for the generation as a whole.

## Intrinsic Rewards

![Alt text](/drafts/intrinsic.png)

One of the most common reasons Millennials are often praised is for their intrinsic motivation to work. That is, the chance to do interesting, creative work, and learn valuable skills. All of this sounds great for Millennials. It may even resonate with your personal experience. There is only one problem. It is patently false. For six out of seven questions relating to intrinsic rewards, Millennials scored significantly lower than Generation X. Millennials as a whole value "A job that is interesting to do" significantly less than Generation X. Millennials value a job that uses uses your skills and abilities - lets you do the things you an do best" significantly less than Generation X. Millennials value "A job where you can see the results of what you do" significantly less than Generation X. Think that Millennials put a premium on authenticity? Think again. Millennials valued having a "job where you do not have to pretend to be a type of person that you are not" significantly less than the previous generation. To be clear, some of the effect sizes are small - they are much smaller than the increases that we saw for Generation X's value for extrinsic rewards, for instance - however they are significant decreases.

## Leisure Rewards

![Alt text](/drafts/leisure.png)

When it comes to working at a leisurely pace, or having a job that allows time off, it appears that each generation progressively values leisure more than the previous generation. This was true for "A job that leaves you a lot of time for other things in your life", "A job where you have more than two weeks of vacation" and "A job with an easy pace that let's you work slowly". 

However, there is one exception. You remember how Millennials are purported to hate being managed? Well, when asked how much they valued "A job that leaves you mostly free of supervision by others" Millennials were significantly less likely to respond in the affirmative than Generation X. If anyone is "allergic to supervision" it's Generation X, not Millennials. One theory that might contribute to this is that Generations workplace values are influenced by the previous generation. One of the notable things about the Baby Boomer generation was that it produced Steve Jobs, born in 1955 and Bill Gates, also born in 1955. The impact of these two men on what would come after is huge. In the 1980s and 1990s, the idea of starting up your own company became much more feasible. Who was starting companies in the 1980s and 1990s? It's not the Millennial generation, its Generation X.

But why the increase in other leisure rewards such as vacation time? With the proliferation of starts ups, it's possible that perks such vacation time are more important in order to compete for the talent that has an increasing amount of options to choose from, and thus workers start to expect these better benefits.

## Altruistic Rewards

![Alt text](/drafts/altruistic.png)

General Electric created a set of humorous parody videos entitled: ["What's the matter with Owen?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpDIEJrog3s) In one of the videos Owen announces to his friends that he has received a software engineering job at General Electric, where he will be able to "transform the way the world works" through "helping turbines power cities". This announcement is overshadowed by one of his friends who works for a (fictitious) company called zazzies where his job is to create funny cat photos. The video implies that Millennials are generally more impressed an app that is ultimately meaningless than the possibility of transforming the world. There might be some truth to that. According to the data, Millennials appear to be very slightly less likely to value work that helps others and is worthwhile to society. However, there is another way to view this data.

## Social Rewards

![Alt text](/drafts/social.png)

Similar to altruistic rewards, social rewards also appear decrease from one generation to the next. Millennials value "A job that gives you a chance to make friends" and "A job that permits contact with lots of people" significantly less than Generation X. One way of looking at this data is to call Millennials anti-social, and blame the increased usage of personal technology, social media, the iPhone, etc… Judging by [one poll](https://reason.com/poll/2014/08/19/65-of-americans-say-millennials-are-enti) this seems to square with popular opinion. Another perspective is too take these responses in light of the [economic hardship](http://www.vox.com/2014/12/16/7391843/millennials-economy-screwed) that Millennials experience. Millennials have higher rates of unemployment, higher student loans, and lower incomes than past generations. Coming from that perspective, working with your friends is higher up the hierarchy of needs, than say, having a job that allows you to be gainfully employed so you can pay off your student loans.

## Conclusion

In summary, Millennials are different than the past generation. They are exposed to a different set of economic realities than the previous generations. But the differences in workplace values are not always what you'd think from reading popular press. For instance, Millennials value interesting work with a societal impact less than Generation X. 

However, we should put all of this discussion in perspective. The generation we were born into is only one aspect of what defines us. Another aspect is our age. Let me leave you with a quote:

> I see no hope for the future of our people if they are dependent on the frivolous youth of today, for certainly all youth are reckless beyond words. When I was a boy, we were taught to be discrete and respectful of elders, but the present youth are exceedingly wise and impatient of restraint.

Does that sound familiar? That's not a 21st century journalist. That's from a man who was a poet. His name was Hesiod; he wrote that in 700 B.C. 

There is a great compilation of news reports over the past 100 years or so focusing on generational differences. The title of the article says it all: [Every Generation is the Me Me Me Generation](http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/05/me-generation-time/65054/). It is possible that you could make the argument that this is because each generation is progressively more selfish than the previous generation. The alternative idea, which I would argue is more reasonable, is that the differences attributed to generation, are often due to age.



## Appendix A: Survey Results

It can be argued that these results are not reliable, not because of the techniques used to analyze data are incorrect, but because survey respondents do not provide trustworthy information about themselves. For instance, who doesn't like saying that they place a high value on helping others? Call it the personal optimism bias (if you want to give it a name): the likelihood to portray oneself in a more positive light than is actually warranted. The conclusions drawn from this analysis don't assume that people are completely truthful about themselves. Rather, it makes the assumption that biases are similar across generations in the same direction, which is a more conservative assumption. That being said, the results can be taken as reported as the basis for meaningful inference.



## Appendix B: PwC Survey

In my research for this article, one popular source of information kept coming up. It was a [2011 survey](https://www.pwc.com/m1/en/services/consulting/documents/millennials-at-work.pdf) administered the worlds largest professional services firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).   The survey did not attempt to control for age, but nevertheless, this survey has been widely cited throughout the internet. It even appeared in the 2015 edition of [Mary Meeker's Internet Trends report](http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends) (see page 110). Here is how PwC summarized their findings:

> The particular characteristics of millennials – such as their ambition and desire to keep learning and move quickly upwards through an organisation, as well as their willingness to move on quickly if their expectations are not being met – requires a focused response from employers. Millennials want a flexible approach to work, but very regular feedback and encouragement. They want to feel their work is worthwhile and that their efforts are being recognized.
