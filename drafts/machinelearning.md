title: Where is Machine Learning on Hype Cycle?
---

Gartner has made a lot of money off of this little squiggle.

The distinction between many of these terms is fuzzy at best: for instance, Ensemble Learning is an extension of Machine Learning, and yet Ensemble Learning is on the Plateau of Productivity while Machine Learning is only on the Peak of Expectations.  Predictive Analytics is generally equivalent with Supervised Machine Learning, but they are listed as two different items on the chart here.

On that same note, there is a lot of commentary on the internet about the discipline of Statistics vs. Machine Learning vs. Data Science. Dr. Leo Breiman (inventor of CART and Random Forests) wrote one of the most famous article on the topic.

As to what is hype vs. real results, Dr. John Elder the IV identifies three key ways that organizations can benefit from Machine Learning. They are:
1) Predicting the Bad
2) Identifying the Good
3) Automating Existing Processes

The term he uses is Data Mining, which is arguably a broader term, but as can be seen from his examples, Machine Learning plays a big role.

Incidentally, Dan Wagner used Machine Learning used to help Barack Obama win the 2008 and 2012 elections (see write-up [here]()) by predicting which voters would be most persuadable. If winning a presidential election isn’t a big enough impact, then I don’t know what is.
