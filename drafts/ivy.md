title: Why do we need probability?
synopsis: Sometimes our intuition tricks us.

The substitution effect is a phsycological bias. Instead of answering the question at hand, we substitute an easier question. For instance, it's easier to answer the question "what do I enjoy doing?" than "what is worth doing?". If asked the latter, human beings are likely to substitute for the former.

This question highlights both the strength and weakenss of using statistics and probability to answer questions. On the one hand, it would be very difficult to answer this particular question using statistics. However, with the tools of statistics and probability it is often possible to give an answer to more complicated questions that we otherwise would not have responses too.
